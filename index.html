I've supported SirHurt until this shit happened.

So I bought SirHurt for my friend, because he couldn't afford it.

And he referred me on SirHurt, but I was unsure how to redeem the 150 Robux I was promised after he referred me.

So, like most people would do, is ask a support member, which is what I did.

When I asked him how to redeem the 150 Robux code i was promised, he was completely confused, which also shows how unexperienced the support team is.

I explained that I figured out how to redeem it.

Then, he asked me for irrelevant questions after I literally told him I figured it out, and proceeds to try to scam me out of the 150 Robux code.

And then, proceeds to send me unneeded information which I never asked for.

- This is why you don't buy SirHurt.
Fun fact: SirHurt's purchases went down by 50% after he got exposed.
