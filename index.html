I've supported SirHurt until this shit happened.
So I bought SirHurt for my friend, because he couldn't afford it.
And he referred me on SirHurt, but I was unsure how to redeem the 150 Robux I was promised after he referred me.
So, like most people would do, is ask a support member, which is what I did.

When I asked him how to redeem the 150 Robux code i was promised, he was completely confused.
