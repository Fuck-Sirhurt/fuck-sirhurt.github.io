I've supported SirHurt until this shit happened.
<br>
<br>
So I bought SirHurt for my friend, because he couldn't afford it.
<br>
And he referred me on SirHurt, but I was unsure how to redeem the 150 Robux I was promised after he referred me.
<br>
So, like most people would do, is ask a support member, which is what I did.
<br>
When I asked a support member how to redeem the 150 Robux code i was promised, he was completely confused, which also shows how unexperienced the support team is.

<br>
I explained that I figured out how to redeem it.

<br>
Then, he asked me for irrelevant questions after I literally told him I figured it out, and proceeds to try to scam me out of the 150 Robux code.

<br>
And then, proceeds to send me unneeded information which I never asked for.

The Helper team for SirHurt is awful and i'm embarassed a 12 year old has my main email address and my IP.

- This is why you should delete your SirHurt account.
<br>
Fun fact: SirHurt's purchases went down by 50% after Claim exposed IcePools.
